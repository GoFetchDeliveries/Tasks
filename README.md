## Working with issues

* Leave a comment in the issue.

## Referencing an issue from outside Github

Each issue has a unique number, which is a convenient way for us to reference it from other documents and emails.  For example we can write in an email: "I am current stuck with #23". Or, in the "Tech Fixes" spreadsheet we can add a column "Issue #" with value `23` for this task.
