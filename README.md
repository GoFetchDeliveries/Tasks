# üê∂ GoFetch tasks

Welcome to the GoFetch tasks! This is where we manage programming tasks ‚Äî bugs and new features ‚Äî for the GoFetch apps.  This list of tasks is in the [issues page](https://github.com/GoFetchDeliveries/Tasks/issues).



## Creating a new issue

* Click  green "New Issues" button in the [issues](https://github.com/GoFetchDeliveries/Tasks/issues) page.
* Write a title and description.
* Add relevant label(s) to the issue: `bug`, `enhancement`, `ios`, `web`, `backend`.

* If known, assign a person to the issue. This way we know why is working on this task.

* Click "Submit issue" button.




## Working with issues

* Leave a comment in the issue. This is a good way to update the team about the progress and communicate with other members. To address a person, write her/his Github username with "@" symbol. For example, here is we are addressing Evgenii and he will receive a notification.

> @evgenyneu, the fix works in iOS v1.4.4 üëç.

* When the work is done, click "Close issue" button.



## Referencing an issue from outside Github

* Each issue has a unique number, which is a convenient way for us to reference it from other documents and emails.

* For example we can write in an email: "I am current stuck with #23". Or, in the "Tech Fixes" spreadsheet we can add a column "Issue #" with value `23` for this task.

* In any Github document, we can just write text "[#2](https://github.com/GoFetchDeliveries/Tasks/issues/2)" (with relevant number) and it will be automatically linked to the issue.

## Tips on writing an awesome bug report

* Write a short title that provides a clear description of a problem. For example: "Crash on customer sign up screen."

* Create four sections:

  * *Overview*: In a couple of sentences, write the description of the issue. Include the version of the iOS app, iPhone model for an iOS bug or the name of the web browser and OS for a web bug.

  * *How to reproduce*: Write steps necessary to reproduce the problem.

  * *Expected behavior*: Write what's expected. Example: "Shows the registration screen".

  * *Actual behavior*: Write what's acrually happening. Example: "The app crashes".
