# 🐶 GoFetch tasks

Welcome to the GoFetch tasks! This is where we manage programming tasks 	— bugs and new features 	— for the GoFetch apps.  This list of tasks is in the [issues page](https://github.com/GoFetchDeliveries/Tasks/issues). 

## Creating a new issue

* Click  green "New Issues" button in the [issues](https://github.com/GoFetchDeliveries/Tasks/issues) page.
* Write a title and desription.
* Add relavant label(s) to the issue: `bug`, `enhancement`, `ios`, `web`, `backend`.

* If known, assign a person to the issue. This way we know why is working on this task.

* Click "Submit issue" button.

## Working with issues

* Leave a comment in the issue. This is a good way to update the team about the progress and communicate with other members. To address a person, write her/his Github username with "@" symbol. For example, here is we are addressing Evgenii and he will receive a notification.

> @evgenyneu, the fix works in iOS v1.4.4 👍.

* When the work is done, click "Close issue" button.

## Referencing an issue from outside Github

Each issue has a unique number, which is a convenient way for us to reference it from other documents and emails.  For example we can write in an email: "I am current stuck with #23". Or, in the "Tech Fixes" spreadsheet we can add a column "Issue #" with value `23` for this task.
