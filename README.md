* Click "Submit issue" button.

## Working with issues

* Leave a comment in the issue. This is a good way to update the team about the progress and communicate with other members. To address a person, write her/his Github username with "@" symbol. For example, here is we are addressing Evgenii and he will receive a notification.

> @evgenyneu, the fix works in iOS v1.4.4 üëç.

* When the work is done, click "Close issue" button.

## Referencing an issue from outside Github

Each issue has a unique number, which is a convenient way for us to reference it from other documents and emails.  For example we can write in an email: "I am current stuck with #23". Or, in the "Tech Fixes" spreadsheet we can add a column "Issue #" with value `23` for this task.

  * *Expected behaviour*: Write what's expected. Example: "Shows the registration screen".
